1. Anomaly Detection

Isolation Forest

Detects anomalies by isolating outliers in the feature space.

Works well with high-dimensional data.

Autoencoders

Neural network-based model for reconstruction-based anomaly detection.

High reconstruction error indicates an anomaly (e.g., unusual traffic).

One-Class SVM

A support vector machine that learns the distribution of normal data.

Anomalous data points are classified as outliers.

2. Clustering

K-Means

Divides data into k clusters based on similarity.

Useful for identifying different types of traffic patterns (e.g., normal, attack).

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)

Identifies clusters based on data density, finding outliers in the process.

Effective for detecting unusual patterns in traffic.

Agglomerative (Hierarchical) Clustering

Builds a hierarchy of clusters by iteratively merging closest data points.

Helps reveal nested structures or relationships in traffic data.

3. Dimensionality Reduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Reduces the number of features while maintaining variance.

Helps in visualizing data and detecting outliers by focusing on the most significant features.

t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

Reduces high-dimensional data to 2 or 3 dimensions for visualization.

Can reveal clusters or anomalies by projecting complex data into simpler forms.
